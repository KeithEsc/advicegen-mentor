### What I learned

Got more experience working with layouts and responsiveness. Learned more about relative positioning which I used for the dice button. Instead of using the divider svgs I decided to make my own with CSS. This resulted in some poor spacing/padding issues but I also didn't need to use any breakpoints. I know my paddings aren't perfect but I'm happy with the result and it's functional.
